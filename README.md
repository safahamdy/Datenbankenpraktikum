# DBPRA â€“ Datenbankenpraktikum (TU Berlin)

This repository contains solutions to four assignments completed as part of the "Datenbankenpraktikum" (DBPRA) module at TU Berlin. 
The work includes SQL-based queries for analyzing relational data and Java implementations for stored procedures, views, and triggers via JDBC.
Each assignment is organized in its own folder. Every SQL query is documented with comments directly inside the `.sql` files.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 01 â€“ Canadian Supplier Value

- Computes available supply values (AVAILQTY Ã— SUPPLYCOST) for Canadian suppliers.
- Filters by a 0.3% threshold and sorts by value and supplier key.
- Uses multiple joins, grouping, and subqueries.

Folder: `assignment01/`  


### Assignment 02 â€“ Supplier & Product Analysis

- Applies nested filters across suppliers, parts, and nations.
- Involves computed values, advanced conditions, and ordering.
- Builds on the schema from Assignment 01.

Folder: `assignment02/`



### Assignment 03 â€“ Joins & Aggregates

- Uses `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and multi-level joins to analyze relationships between parts and suppliers.
- Adds conditional filters and computes ratios or comparisons.

Folder: `assignment03/`


###  Assignment 04 â€“ SQL + Java Integration

- Combines SQL logic with Java (JDBC).
- Features:
  - UDFs: `HAVERSINE`, `ROUND4`
  - Views: `DISTANCE_PLACES`, `AVG_DISTANCE`
  - Trigger: `DISTANCE_PLACES_UPDATE`
  - Procedure: `ComputeAffiliationsOfBars`

Folder: `assignment04/`  



##  Database Schema

All queries and logic refer to the schema provided below:

> 


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible)
- **Java** (JDBC API)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (as development environment)


## Notes

- SQL queries are explained directly in each `.sql` file with comments.
- Java code assumes an existing `Connection` object and uses `Statement` for execution.
- Developed for the DBPRA course in Winter Semester 2024/2025 at TU Berlin.
